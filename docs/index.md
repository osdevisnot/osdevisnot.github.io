# :wave: Welcome to Uncharted Constructs of Tech, Finance, and Life

Hey! I’m Abhishek, a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Zillow, where I solve tough problems in **distributed systems design and architecture** and **finance and mortgage tech**. This space is where I share my journey through **technology**, **finance**, and **life** - exploring how these worlds intersect in meaningful ways.

My journey started with an insatiable curiosity (and maybe a bit too much coffee :coffee:). As I dove into **distributed computing** and **system design**, I learned that scalability isn't just a technical hurdle - it’s a way of thinking. Early on, I began working on systems that needed to be **resilient**, **adaptive**, and **future-ready**. At Zillow, I’ve led the design of platforms powering the home loans business, keeping everything **scalable**, **secure**, and aligned with industry standards.

Beyond the technical world, I believe that **finance** is another system worth mastering. Whether building a portfolio or managing resources, the same principles of architecture and resilience apply. In this blog, I’ll dive into strategies for navigating both the tech and financial landscapes.

And, of course, **life** isn't just about work and money. It’s about finding balance, exploring new ideas, and reflecting on experiences that shape us. From lessons in **programming** to reflections on **life’s journey**, I’ll share insights that have helped me grow, both personally and professionally.

Join me on this adventure, where we’ll explore the uncharted territories of **tech**, **finance**, and **life** - one construct at a time.

Head over to my [Blog](blog/index.md) for my latest thoughts on **programming**, **system design**, and **finance**. Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishekisnot) if you want to chat!
