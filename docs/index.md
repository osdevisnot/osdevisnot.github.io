:wave: Hey! Iâ€™m Abhishek, a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Zillow, where I solve tough problems in **distributed systems design** and **financial tech**. My passion? Building systems that donâ€™t just workâ€”but work **seamlessly**, **securely**, and at **scale**.

Curiosity (and maybe a little too much coffee :coffee:) led me to **distributed computing**, where I learned that **scalability** isnâ€™t just a technical issue - itâ€™s a mindset. Early on, I embraced the challenge of making systems **resilient** and **future-proof**. At Zillow, Iâ€™ve shaped platforms that power the home loans business, ensuring they stay scalable and secure, while keeping business needs front and center.

For me, programming is about **crafting solutions** that matter. Itâ€™s more than codeâ€”itâ€™s solving real problems with creativity and collaboration. From transforming loan origination at **Ellie Mae** to leveraging **AI** and **machine learning**, I focus on building systems that stand the test of time.

I believe **sharing knowledge** is key to growth. Through my **blog**, I dive into everything from **system design** to **programming paradigms**, sharing lessons learned and ideas for building better systems.

Letâ€™s connect! Check out my [Research](research.md) or the latest on **programming** and **system design** on my [Blog](blog/index.md). Reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishekisnot) or shoot me an [email](mailto:osdevisnot@gmail.com) ðŸ“§.
